[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m still around~ and Vladleen drawing! (scroll for timelapse)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while, I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have something new to share today!\nIt may look like this account is dead or that I\u0026rsquo;ve vanished, but the truth is that it\u0026rsquo;s normal – drawing is not all that I do, but it\u0026rsquo;s all I can share for now, so that\u0026rsquo;s why there are long stretches of nothing between bursts of posts.\nI work on worldbuilding, story development/writing, and programming when I don\u0026rsquo;t draw, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit difficult to share that (text is not very attractive + spoilers for the games).\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to find ways to have more consistent content to share, hopefully that works out. Due to an illness I have limited energy each day and I\u0026rsquo;d rather focus it all on my stories and games than drawing for social media, that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find a balance.\nAnyway, I wanted to be clear on why there\u0026rsquo;s often no activity on my accounts, and that it\u0026rsquo;s never because I gave up on my projects. I\u0026rsquo;m just very slow, but no matter what I always come back c:\nAbout Lulling / lullinglore:\nI decided to change into a new username online and I was supposed to announce that at the same time as another big thing but, looks like I gotta do it earlier than expected c':\nI\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a separate announcement for it later with some more info but I have already secured the new handle @lullinglore everywhere, and I\u0026rsquo;m keeping Lulullia as display name for now to avoid confusion (I\u0026rsquo;ll permanently transition to Lulling some time later).\nFrom now on all my drawings will have the new signature too!\nThanks for being here and I\u0026rsquo;d love to say hello on socials~ I\u0026rsquo;m patiently but excitedly waiting for the day I can share my first narrative game with everyone * v * in the meantime, have a beautiful day!\nTimelapse ","date":"2025-11-22T20:42:15+01:00","image":"https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/251101.png","permalink":"https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2025/vladleen-duo/","title":"Vladleen duo"},{"content":"Ava ~ Blind devotion\nSkilled with the spear and with a tongue as sharp as her blade, this headstrong, gossip-loving kitsune escaped life as a royal family relative back on Krakenspire, to the sweet comfort and freedom of the Dolphilie. She settled in Hye\u0026rsquo;s manor after meeting Lurleen, officially working as her bodyguard; but everybody can see the powerful sisterly love bonding these two. Things start going south as Vladimir shows up – the worst person to put in front of Ava – and it\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time before the bomb goes off.\nTried new things – it went in a more graphic style this time. I like the effect on this piece, but I think I prefer the softer feel of the [[Orrion Characters 1 ~ Lurleen|previous one]]. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to render my drawings because I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the process of painting, but it\u0026rsquo;s still nice to have a quick shaded effect, so I probably won\u0026rsquo;t make more pieces in this clean coloring style.\nAs always, adding text is super fun and adds so much to the whole thing. I really ought to sort my fonts tho, scrolling a list for 30 minutes trying out every single one is not scaleable at all x)\nTimelapse ","date":"2025-06-15T15:50:16+01:00","image":"https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/250601.jpg","permalink":"https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2025/orrion-characters-2-ava/","title":"Orrion Characters #2 ~ Ava"},{"content":"I am officially a jellyfish now °v°\nLuli the jelli. actually this sounds pretty nice\nI wish there was a jelly emoji, but alas, will have to make-do with this 💦\nIn the end I decided to use a cropped version as actual profile pic :c I\u0026rsquo;m sad but it\u0026rsquo;s the only way to have it look like something that can be recognized as a jellyfish.\nWhich I guess made me learn that… you should always preview your art in the context in which it\u0026rsquo;ll be used asap… (yea i\u0026rsquo;ll just pretend i didn\u0026rsquo;t already know this and didn\u0026rsquo;t do it out of sheer lazyness)\nIn other news! Major announcement to come soon. I\u0026rsquo;m preparing something that I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to share but,,, not yet. This is why there have been no posts on socials these days.

Softspoken, emotional and highly sensitive to what goes on between the lines, she lacks a great deal of real-world experience, partly thanks to her amnesia; when Vladimir found her, she was thirteen and didn\u0026rsquo;t even remember her name. Now a distinguished lady under Lord Hye\u0026rsquo;s care, and with Vlad back at her side, Lurleen is ready to fight for her place in this world.\nVery proud of this one. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how, because I never draw, but my lines got so much better, and linework in general. I think I was working against myself before when I tried doing lineart on top of an already good-looking sketch; maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why I always dreaded the lineart phase. It just sucked out all the personality of the sketch. Now I use the sketch as lineart, and I feel way more joy drawing this way.\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;m in love with the basic round brush with opacity. Literally the only brush I use to draw (but not render). It has such a nice soft look to it! And is very pleasant to use.\nThis piece took way longer than I expected though, and to think I was planning on finishing ones like this every 2-3 days… Well, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get faster over time.\nAnyway, excited for the next one (spoiler: it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be Vlad [edit: well guess not]) c:\u0026lt;\nTimelapse ","date":"2025-05-22T18:36:32+01:00","image":"https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/250501.png","permalink":"https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2025/orrion-characters-1-lurleen/","title":"Orrion Characters #1 ~ Lurleen"},{"content":"Lulu c:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been months and I really expected nothing but it came out so great still!

Welcome to my corner of the internet!\nThis blog is still new and under construction – but it is now 100% functional so I can already start posting!\nHere you\u0026rsquo;ll find art, stories, worldbuilding for the world I\u0026rsquo;m working on, and all sorts of devlogs; I make narrative games but also dabble in a ton of other technical stuff (this website here is one of them – Hugo is one gem of a framework *v*).\nMy old blog\u0026rsquo;s about page still does a good job introducing all that, so give it a read if you\u0026rsquo;re interested! Read on for a more technical introduction.\nWhat is this place? Social media never gave me nearly enough customization options, and I\u0026rsquo;m not comfortable keeping my notes on a platform that could vanish anytime; so it was only a matter of time till I decided to make my very own, full-fledged website. And it\u0026rsquo;s not just a website; it\u0026rsquo;s basically (a portion of) my Obsidian vault, with superpowers *w*\nSo most of the pages here are actually just notes inside my PKM, and that includes the world wiki. As I develop my world in the form of articles, the Orrion section will get populated, too. It works the same for the blog; it\u0026rsquo;s actually really nice to be able to write posts from the comfort of my vault.\nFor now the posts look rather plain on the website, but as I get around to it, it\u0026rsquo;ll become something much, much more interconnected and interesting to navigate. All pages already contain a lot of currently hidden metadata, that will eventually be used to display relevant info and list them in all sorts of places – I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to implementing all that! Also I have big plans for the world wiki, I\u0026rsquo;d like to make it as immersive and interactive as possible, so stay tuned c:\u0026lt;\nObviously none of this would have ever been possible just on socials (and even Tumblr which is the most customizable option I know), though I\u0026rsquo;ll still be active on Tumblr and Game Jolt. Give me a follow if you\u0026rsquo;d like, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t use that, there\u0026rsquo;s still the good old email newsletter option! But don\u0026rsquo;t expect much activity on there for a while, as I need to push out more content first.\nNext up My current focus is on worldbuilding, and more specifically global geography. I aim to get a solid geographical base for my world, and so have completed the rather huge undertaking of simulating the planet\u0026rsquo;s tectonic history. Next is figuring out what kind of land that gives me, aka topography; then will come global climate. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, I can focus in developing the areas where my stories take place.\nIn parallel, I work on Project Purple, the first narrative game and a \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo; practice project. It\u0026rsquo;s set in my world but to progress as quickly as possible on it, I decided to not wait for the worldbuilding to be completed first; so it\u0026rsquo;s going to use whatever latest version of my world exists in my head, and I expect some things to be retconned later, but it\u0026rsquo;s fine. The story is self-contained and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need much context to work.\nAlso in parallel, I might continue working on this website (the visuals and features of it) because it\u0026rsquo;s clearly not up to my standards right now. But hey, I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for it to be perfect before I can use it either. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be messy sometimes!\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s about it for now.

It made me learn about a bazillion things not to repeat ever again.\nAll things considered though, it came out pretty good! I wanted to give up so many times and there were so many catastrophes I’m really surprised in how clean it looks.\nI’m even more surprised that I was able to push through and bring it to the finish despite it all, it’s something to celebrate ;-;\nA lil’ summary of what this piece taught me ⤵\nI really need to study the rest of the human anatomy. The legs were difficult, the feet too. I only realize this now because I mostly draw torsos and simple poses. Also, first time I draw characters interacting – it was fun but it’s really something I need to practice more! If I plan on using the sketch as lineart, please for the love of God use an opaque brush. The amount of time I spent fixing the lineart because it was semi-transparent, I might as well have drawn 3 layers of proper lineart. Keep an eye on the background color. Because of some transparency stuff, I didn’t realize some parts of the drawing only looked right with the current bg color – so when I thought I was done and changed it, I stared in horror at the ugly artifacts all around the drawing. It was painful to fix. Sometimes it’s easier to just draw over the sketch, taking the lines I like, instead of cleaning it up. Because using the sketch layer – especially with an opacity brush – leaves around a ton of barely visible artifacts. I had to “select opaque” to see them and clear them out, and it was also painful. Generally, going into a drawing without a plan for what style it’s gonna be is a bad idea and results in a lot of problems down the line. Better fix any problems I have with the drawing as early as possible, because I’ll end up fixing it anyway, only if I’m too far in the process it’ll cost me more time. I need to stop drawing too detailed an anatomy if I know it’s gonna get covered by clothes anyway… T-T Phew, I’m still shocked that I managed to make a decent piece even after all these problems. Somehow I feel pretty good about it, I think the joy of seeing it finished made all my bad experience with it go away.\nIt’s great, especially since I’ve been struggling a lot with self-doubt about my creative projects recently; this shows me that no matter how crappy something seems to be, if only I push through and finish it, all that bad energy turns into incredibly good feelings of accomplishment and pride.\nHope that’s useful; now I really want to make a mini story game and see how it turns out…\n","date":"2023-07-09T16:59:22+01:00","image":"https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/230602.jpg","permalink":"https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2023/vladleen-photo/","title":"Vladleen photo"},{"content":"First character portrait from Project Circus featuring Nom, the youngest member of the crew!\nShe has the unsettling habit of always munching on her fingers, despite the collective efforts of the other members to make her stop.
