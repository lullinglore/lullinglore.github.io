&lt;p&gt;A loving and spontaneous young woman with the big dream of restoring her and her people&amp;rsquo;s long lost home – Lyphuriaa. Softspoken, emotional and highly sensitive to what goes on between the lines, she lacks a great deal of real-world experience, partly thanks to her amnesia; when Vladimir found her, she was thirteen and didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember her name. Now a distinguished lady under Lord Hye&amp;rsquo;s care, and with Vlad back at her side, Lurleen is ready to fight for her place in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very proud of this one. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how, because I never draw, but my lines got so much better, and linework in general. I think I was working against myself before when I tried doing lineart on top of an already good-looking sketch; maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I always dreaded the lineart phase. It just sucked out all the personality of the sketch. Now I use the sketch as lineart, and I feel way more joy drawing this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in love with the basic round brush with opacity. Literally the only brush I use to draw (but not render). It has such a nice soft look to it! And is very pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece took way longer than I expected though, and to think I was planning on finishing ones like this every 2-3 days… Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get faster over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, excited for the next one &lt;del&gt;(spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be Vlad)&lt;/del&gt; c:&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been months and I really expected nothing but it came out so great still! Maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s a simpler subject? Drawing busts is pretty easy and fun, will do that more. Also, playing around with effects and textures at the end was interesting – I tried copying some techniques I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in gorgeous artworks from games I play, and it turned out really good!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vladleen photo</title>
        <link>https://lulullia.github.io/entry/2023/art-vladleen-photo/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://lulullia.github.io/img/art/230602.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Vladleen photo" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn’t Lulu so cute? She probably had to beg for days to convince Vlad to make such a cheesy gesture…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-log&#34;&gt;Progress log
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;God this one was especially hard, not really because of what I was drawing but because of &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;. It made me learn about a bazillion things &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to repeat &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered though, it came out pretty good! I wanted to give up so many times and there were so many catastrophes I’m really surprised in how clean it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m even more surprised that I was able to push through and bring it to the finish despite it all, it’s something to celebrate ;-;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lil’ summary of what this piece taught me ⤵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really need to study the rest of the human anatomy. The legs were difficult, the feet too. I only realize this now because I mostly draw torsos and simple poses. Also, first time I draw characters interacting – it was fun but it’s really something I need to practice more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I plan on using the sketch as lineart, please for the love of God use an opaque brush. The amount of time I spent fixing the lineart because it was semi-transparent, I might as well have drawn 3 layers of proper lineart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on the background color. Because of some transparency stuff, I didn’t realize some parts of the drawing only looked right with the current bg color – so when I thought I was done and changed it, I stared in horror at the ugly artifacts all around the drawing. It was painful to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it’s easier to just draw over the sketch, taking the lines I like, instead of cleaning it up. Because using the sketch layer – especially with an opacity brush – leaves around a ton of barely visible artifacts. I had to “select opaque” to see them and clear them out, and it was also painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, going into a drawing without a plan for what style it’s gonna be is a bad idea and results in a lot of problems down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better fix any problems I have with the drawing as early as possible, because I’ll end up fixing it anyway, only if I’m too far in the process it’ll cost me more time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to stop drawing too detailed an anatomy if I know it’s gonna get covered by clothes anyway… T-T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, I’m still shocked that I managed to make a decent piece even after all these problems. Somehow I feel pretty good about it, I think the joy of seeing it finished made all my bad experience with it go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great, especially since I’ve been struggling a lot with self-doubt about my creative projects recently; this shows me that no matter how crappy something seems to be, if only I push through and finish it, all that bad energy turns into incredibly good feelings of accomplishment and pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope that’s useful; now I really want to make a mini story game and see how it turns out…&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://lulullia.github.io/entry/2022/art-lulu-bust/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://lulullia.github.io/img/art/220101.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Lulu bust" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so happy with this one. Not only it’s good to finish a piece, but I also learned how to render with it. I followed a tut and it’s not so hard after all x)&lt;br&gt;
I was mostly focused on anatomy up until now, and I’m excited to switch the focus of my art studies to color, lighting and rendering!&lt;/p&gt;
