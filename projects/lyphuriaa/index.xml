        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/260201.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Lulu colored sketch" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly getting back to drawing with unplanned doodles, just going where the fun takes me! Starting on paper makes it easier (to start drawing, because I&amp;rsquo;m often too lazy to set up my tablet ;v;) but the downside is, that same laziness manifests when drawing traditionally and makes me avoid erasing, so I don&amp;rsquo;t correct the mistakes even though I see them °v°&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s fine, these are just sketches to find the fun back, and I could adjust some things during the coloring. And I did have lots of fun experimenting with the lighting! I think it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I do something like this, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve known for a long time that I wanted a dark world, just to create such moody, ethereal atmospheres. There&amp;rsquo;s something pretty satisfying in adding glow and pushing the contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, lots of things don&amp;rsquo;t quite make sense in this piece due to the lack of thought put in it, but it was successful in its purpose of reviving my excitement for drawing, so it&amp;rsquo;s a win in my book &amp;lt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2025/vladleen-duo/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/251101.png" alt="Featured image of post Vladleen duo" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still around~ and Vladleen drawing! &lt;em&gt;(scroll for timelapse)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have something new to share today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may look like this account is dead or that I&amp;rsquo;ve vanished, but the truth is that it&amp;rsquo;s normal – drawing is not all that I do, but it&amp;rsquo;s all I can share for now, so that&amp;rsquo;s why there are long stretches of nothing between bursts of posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work on worldbuilding, story development/writing, and programming when I don&amp;rsquo;t draw, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit difficult to share that (text is not very attractive + spoilers for the games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find ways to have more consistent content to share, hopefully that works out. Due to an illness I have limited energy each day and I&amp;rsquo;d rather focus it all on my stories and games than drawing for social media, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to be clear on why there&amp;rsquo;s often no activity on my accounts, and that it&amp;rsquo;s never because I gave up on my projects. I&amp;rsquo;m just very slow, but no matter what I always come back c:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Lulling / lullinglore:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to change into a new username online and I was supposed to announce that at the same time as another big thing but, looks like I gotta do it earlier than expected c&#39;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a separate announcement for it later with some more info but I have already secured the new handle &lt;strong&gt;@lullinglore&lt;/strong&gt; everywhere, and I&amp;rsquo;m keeping Lulullia as display name for now to avoid confusion (I&amp;rsquo;ll permanently transition to Lulling some time later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on all my drawings will have the new signature too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for being here and I&amp;rsquo;d love to say hello on socials~ I&amp;rsquo;m patiently but excitedly waiting for the day I can share my first narrative game with everyone * v * in the meantime, have a beautiful day!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Orrion Characters #2 ~ Ava</title>
        <link>https://lullinglore.github.io/entry/2025/orrion-characters-2-ava/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/250601.png" alt="Featured image of post Orrion Characters #2 ~ Ava" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ava ~ Blind devotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled with the spear and with a tongue as sharp as her blade, this headstrong, gossip-loving kitsune escaped life as a royal family relative back on Krakenspire, to the sweet comfort and freedom of the Dolphilie. She settled in Hye&amp;rsquo;s manor after meeting Lurleen, officially working as her bodyguard; but everybody can see the powerful sisterly love bonding these two. Things start going south as Vladimir shows up – the worst person to put in front of Ava – and it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the bomb goes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried new things – it went in a more graphic style this time. I like the effect on this piece, but I think I prefer the softer feel of the [[Orrion Characters 1 ~ Lurleen|previous one]]. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to render my drawings because I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the process of painting, but it&amp;rsquo;s still nice to have a quick shaded effect, so I probably won&amp;rsquo;t make more pieces in this clean coloring style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, adding text is super fun and adds so much to the whole thing. I really ought to sort my fonts tho, scrolling a list for 30 minutes trying out every single one is not scaleable at all x)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Orrion Characters #1 ~ Lurleen</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/250501.png" alt="Featured image of post Orrion Characters #1 ~ Lurleen" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lurleen ~ Clawed innocence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loving and spontaneous young woman with the big dream of restoring her and her people&amp;rsquo;s long lost home – Lyphuriaa. Softspoken, emotional and highly sensitive to what goes on between the lines, she lacks a great deal of real-world experience, partly thanks to her amnesia; when Vladimir found her, she was thirteen and didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember her name. Now a distinguished lady under Lord Hye&amp;rsquo;s care, and with Vlad back at her side, Lurleen is ready to fight for her place in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very proud of this one. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how, because I never draw, but my lines got so much better, and linework in general. I think I was working against myself before when I tried doing lineart on top of an already good-looking sketch; maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I always dreaded the lineart phase. It just sucked out all the personality of the sketch. Now I use the sketch as lineart, and I feel way more joy drawing this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;m in love with the basic round brush with opacity. Literally the only brush I use to draw (but not render). It has such a nice soft look to it! And is very pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece took way longer than I expected though, and to think I was planning on finishing ones like this every 2-3 days… Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get faster over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, excited for the next one &lt;del&gt;(spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be Vlad [edit: well guess not])&lt;/del&gt; c:&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been months and I really expected nothing but it came out so great still! Maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s a simpler subject? Drawing busts is pretty easy and fun, will do that more. Also, playing around with effects and textures at the end was interesting – I tried copying some techniques I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in gorgeous artworks from games I play, and it turned out really good!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/230602.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Vladleen photo" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lulu probably had to beg for days to convince Vlad to make such a cheesy gesture…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;follow-up-drawing&#34;&gt;Follow-up drawing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few kind persons gave me a shout-out over on Game Jolt and a lot of new people came to follow my account – so I made a small thank you drawing &amp;lt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-log&#34;&gt;Progress log
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;God this one was especially hard, not really because of what I was drawing but because of &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;. It made me learn about a bazillion things &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to repeat &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered though, it came out pretty good! I wanted to give up so many times and there were so many catastrophes I’m really surprised in how clean it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m even more surprised that I was able to push through and bring it to the finish despite it all, it’s something to celebrate ;-;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lil’ summary of what this piece taught me ⤵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really need to study the rest of the human anatomy. The legs were difficult, the feet too. I only realize this now because I mostly draw torsos and simple poses. Also, first time I draw characters interacting – it was fun but it’s really something I need to practice more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I plan on using the sketch as lineart, please for the love of God use an opaque brush. The amount of time I spent fixing the lineart because it was semi-transparent, I might as well have drawn 3 layers of proper lineart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on the background color. Because of some transparency stuff, I didn’t realize some parts of the drawing only looked right with the current bg color – so when I thought I was done and changed it, I stared in horror at the ugly artifacts all around the drawing. It was painful to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it’s easier to just draw over the sketch, taking the lines I like, instead of cleaning it up. Because using the sketch layer – especially with an opacity brush – leaves around a ton of barely visible artifacts. I had to “select opaque” to see them and clear them out, and it was also painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, going into a drawing without a plan for what style it’s gonna be is a bad idea and results in a lot of problems down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better fix any problems I have with the drawing as early as possible, because I’ll end up fixing it anyway, only if I’m too far in the process it’ll cost me more time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to stop drawing too detailed an anatomy if I know it’s gonna get covered by clothes anyway… T-T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, I’m still shocked that I managed to make a decent piece even after all these problems. Somehow I feel pretty good about it, I think the joy of seeing it finished made all my bad experience with it go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great, especially since I’ve been struggling a lot with self-doubt about my creative projects recently; this shows me that no matter how crappy something seems to be, if only I push through and finish it, all that bad energy turns into incredibly good feelings of accomplishment and pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope that’s useful; now I really want to make a mini story game and see how it turns out…&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://lullinglore.github.io/img/art/220101.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Lulu bust" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so happy with this one. Not only it’s good to finish a piece, but I also learned how to render with it. I followed a tut and it’s not so hard after all x)&lt;br&gt;
I was mostly focused on anatomy up until now, and I’m excited to switch the focus of my art studies to color, lighting and rendering!&lt;/p&gt;
